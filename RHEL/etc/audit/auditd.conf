## CIS # 4.1.2.1 Ensure audit log storage size is configured
## auditd only controls the size of logs, not the retention
max_log_file = 1024m
## Disable STIG default
## max_log_file = 8

## CIS 4.1.2.2 Ensure audit logs are not automatically deleted
## The max_log_file_action setting determines how to handle the audit log file reaching the
## max file size. A value of keep_logs will rotate the logs but never delete old logs.
## max_log_file_action = keep_logs
## REJECTED

## xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_auditd_data_retention_max_log_file_action
## Configure auditd max_log_file_action Upon Reaching Maximum Log Size
## The default action to take when the logs reach their maximum size is to rotate the log files, discarding the oldest one.
## Possible values for ACTION are described in the auditd.conf man page. These include:
## ignore
## syslog
## suspend
## rotate
## keep_logs
## Set the ACTION to rotate to ensure log rotation occurs. This is the default. The setting is case-insensitive.

## Automatically rotating logs (by setting this to rotate) minimizes the chances of the system unexpectedly running out of
## disk space by being overwhelmed with log data. However, for systems that must never discard log data, or which use
## external processes to transfer it and reclaim space, keep_logs can be employed.

## Keep 30 days of Audit logging, 30 days of archive + 1 log referring to the current day
max_log_file_action = IGNORE
num_logs = 31

## Disable STIG defaults
## max_log_file_action = ROTATE
## num_logs = 5

## CIS 4.1.2.3 Ensure system is disabled when audit logs are full
## The auditd daemon can be configured to halt the system when the audit logs are full.
## In high security contexts, the risk of detecting unauthorized access or nonrepudiation
## exceeds the benefit of the system's availability.
## REJECT
## admin_space_left_action = halt

## xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_auditd_data_retention_admin_space_left_action
## Configure auditd admin_space_left Action on Low Disk Space
## The auditd service can be configured to take an action when disk space is running low but prior to running out of space completely
## Set this value to single to cause the system to switch to single user mode for corrective action. Acceptable values also include suspend and halt.
## For certain systems, the need for availability outweighs the need to log all actions, and a different setting should be determined.
## Details regarding all possible values for ACTION are described in the auditd.conf man page.
## Rationale: Administrators should be made aware of an inability to record audit records. If a separate partition or logical volume
## of adequate size is used, running low on space for audit records should never occur.

## STIG
## V-230388 The RHEL 8 System Administrator (SA) and Information System Security Officer (ISSO)
## (at a minimum) must be alerted of an audit processing failure event.
action_mail_acct = root
admin_space_left = 50

## STIG
## V-244543 RHEL 8 must notify the System Administrator (SA) and Information System Security Officer (ISSO)
## (at a minimum) when allocated audit record storage volume 75 percent utilization.
## If security personnel are not notified immediately when storage volume reaches 75 percent utilization,
## they are unable to plan for audit record storage capacity expansion.

## Possible values for ACTION are described in the auditd.conf man page. These include:
## syslog
## email
## exec
## suspend
## single
## halt
## Set this to email (instead of the default, which is suspend) as it is more likely to get prompt attention.
## Acceptable values also include suspend, single, and halt.

## suspend will pause the auditing system if it encounters a condition that triggers this action, such as the audit
## log storage reaching a critical threshold. This doesn't shut down the system but rather pauses audit logging until
## the issue is resolved or until audit logging is manually restarted. This means the system will continue to operate,
## but it will not record audit events, which could lead to a gap in the audit logs.

## halt means that if the specified audit condition is met, the system will be brought to a complete stop. This is a more
## drastic measure than suspend as it affects the entire system, not just the audit process. A halt action would be used in
## situations where continuing operation without audit capabilities is considered unacceptable from a security standpoint.
## When halt is triggered, the system will shut down entirely, thereby preventing any use of the system until it is manually
## restarted and the issue causing the audit condition is resolved.

## email requires SMTP to be configured, which exposes the endpoint to data exfiltration in case it stores sensitive data

## V-230395
## Without establishing what type of events occurred, the source of events, where events occurred, and the outcome of events,
## it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack. Audit record
## content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses,
## user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control
## rules invoked. Enriched logging aids in making sense of who, what, and when events occur on a system. Without this, determining
## root cause of an event will be much more difficult.
## For example, ENRICHED resolve id's to names. This is available from auditd > 2.6.
