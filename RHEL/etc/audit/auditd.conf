## CIS # 4.1.2.1 Ensure audit log storage size is configured
## auditd only controls the size of logs, not the retention

## Disable STIG default
## max_log_file = 8

## CIS 4.1.2.2 Ensure audit logs are not automatically deleted
## The max_log_file_action setting determines how to handle the audit log file reaching the
## max file size. A value of keep_logs will rotate the logs but never delete old logs.
## max_log_file_action = keep_logs
## REJECTED
## Keep 30 days of Audit logging, 30 days of archive + 1 log referring to the current day
max_log_file_action = IGNORE
num_logs = 31

## Disable STIG defaults
## max_log_file_action = ROTATE
## num_logs = 5

## CIS 4.1.2.3 Ensure system is disabled when audit logs are full
## The auditd daemon can be configured to halt the system when the audit logs are full.
## In high security contexts, the risk of detecting unauthorized access or nonrepudiation
## exceeds the benefit of the system's availability.
## REJECT
## admin_space_left_action = halt

## STIG
## V-230388 The RHEL 8 System Administrator (SA) and Information System Security Officer (ISSO)
## (at a minimum) must be alerted of an audit processing failure event.
action_mail_acct = root
admin_space_left = 50

## STIG
## V-244543 RHEL 8 must notify the System Administrator (SA) and Information System Security Officer (ISSO)
## (at a minimum) when allocated audit record storage volume 75 percent utilization.
## If security personnel are not notified immediately when storage volume reaches 75 percent utilization,
## they are unable to plan for audit record storage capacity expansion.

## Possible values for ACTION are described in the auditd.conf man page. These include:
## syslog
## email
## exec
## suspend
## single
## halt
## Set this to email (instead of the default, which is suspend) as it is more likely to get prompt attention.
## Acceptable values also include suspend, single, and halt.

## suspend will pause the auditing system if it encounters a condition that triggers this action, such as the audit
## log storage reaching a critical threshold. This doesn't shut down the system but rather pauses audit logging until
## the issue is resolved or until audit logging is manually restarted. This means the system will continue to operate,
## but it will not record audit events, which could lead to a gap in the audit logs.

## halt means that if the specified audit condition is met, the system will be brought to a complete stop. This is a more
## drastic measure than suspend as it affects the entire system, not just the audit process. A halt action would be used in
## situations where continuing operation without audit capabilities is considered unacceptable from a security standpoint.
## When halt is triggered, the system will shut down entirely, thereby preventing any use of the system until it is manually
## restarted and the issue causing the audit condition is resolved.

## email requires SMTP to be configured, which exposes the endpoint to data exfiltration in case it stores sensitive data
