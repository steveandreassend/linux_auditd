## LOLBins Used for Defense Evasion
##   Ref: https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/

## The adversary is trying to avoid being detected.

## Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their
## compromise. Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software
## or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes
## to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tactics’ techniques are cross-listed here when those
## techniques include the added benefit of subverting defenses.

## T1562 - Impair Defenses: Adversaries may disable or modify security software to avoid detection.

##  T1070 - Indicator Removal on Host: Adversaries may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system to remove evidence of their presence.

## Adversaries may delete or modify artifacts generated within systems to remove evidence of their presence or hinder defenses.
## Various artifacts may be created by an adversary or something that can be attributed to an adversary’s actions. Typically
## these artifacts are used as defensive indicators related to monitored events, such as strings from downloaded files, logs
## that are generated from user actions, and other data analyzed by defenders. Location, format, and type of artifact
## (such as command or login history) are often specific to each platform.

## Removal of these indicators may interfere with event collection, reporting, or other processes used to detect intrusion activity.
## This may compromise the integrity of security solutions by causing notable events to go unreported. This activity may also impede
## forensic analysis and incident response, due to lack of sufficient data to determine what occurred.

## Indicator Removal: Clear Linux or Mac System Logs

## Adversaries may clear system logs to hide evidence of an intrusion. macOS and Linux both keep track of system or user-initiated actions
## via system logs. The majority of native system logging is stored under the /var/log/ directory. Subfolders in this directory categorize
## logs by their related functions, such as:
## /var/log/messages:: General and system-related messages
## /var/log/secure or /var/log/auth.log: Authentication logs
## /var/log/utmp or /var/log/wtmp: Login records
## /var/log/kern.log: Kernel logs
## /var/log/cron.log: Crond logs

## Indicator Removal: Clear Command History

## In addition to clearing system logs, an adversary may clear the command history of a compromised account to
## conceal the actions undertaken during an intrusion. Various command interpreters keep track of the commands
## users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.

## On Linux and macOS, these command histories can be accessed in a few different ways. While logged in, this command history
## is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable HISTFILE. When a user logs off a system, this information is
## flushed to a file in the user's home directory called ~/.bash_history. The benefit of this is that it allows users to go
## back to commands they've used before in different sessions.

## Adversaries may delete their commands from these logs by manually clearing the history (history -c) or deleting the bash history file rm ~/.bash_history.
## auditd doesn't support wildcards in the path field like /home/*/.bash_history. This is because auditd needs to resolve the paths at the time the rule is loaded, and wildcards would require constant re-evaluation, which isn't how it's designed to work.
## One possibility is to periodically iterate through all /home directories and generate the auditd rules, but it is not very practical
## At the minimum, it is recommended to add rules for known specific application accounts:
##-a always,exit -F path=/home/user1/.bash_history -S write,truncate,chmod,fchmod,unlink,rename -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k T1070_Clear_Command_History

## Indicator Removal: File Deletion

## Adversaries may delete files left behind by the actions of their intrusion activity. Malware, tools, or other non-native
## files dropped or created on a system by an adversary (ex: Ingress Tool Transfer) may leave traces to indicate to what was
## done within a network and how. Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion process
## to minimize the adversary's footprint.

## There are tools available from the host operating system to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well.
## Examples of built-in Command and Scripting Interpreter functions include del on Windows and rm or unlink on Linux and macOS.

## Monitor execution of the rm command
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -F path=/bin/rm -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k T1070_File_Deletion
## Be wary of a log storm if there is a regular bulk file deletion operation, and adapt the user filter accordingly

## Monitor execution of the unlink command
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -F path=/bin/unlink -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k T1070_File_Deletion

## Indicator Removal: Timestomp

## Adversaries may modify file time attributes to hide new files or changes to existing files. Timestomping is a technique
## that modifies the timestamps of a file (the modify, access, create, and change times), often to mimic files that are in the
## same folder and blend malicious files with legitimate files.

## Both the $STANDARD_INFORMATION ($SI) and $FILE_NAME ($FN) attributes record times in a Master File Table (MFT) file.
## $SI (dates/time stamps) is displayed to the end user, including in the File System view, while $FN is dealt with by the kernel.

## Modifying the $SI attribute is the most common method of timestomping because it can be modified at the user level using API calls.
## $FN timestomping, however, typically requires interacting with the system kernel or moving or renaming a file.

## Adversaries modify timestamps on files so that they do not appear conspicuous to forensic investigators or file analysis tools.
## In order to evade detections that rely on identifying discrepancies between the $SI and $FN attributes, adversaries may also engage
## in "double timestomping" by modifying times on both attributes simultaneously.

## Timestomping may be used along with file name Masquerading to hide malware and tools.

## Indicator Removal: Clear Network Connection History and Configurations

## Adversaries may clear or remove evidence of malicious network connections in order to clean up traces of
## their operations. Configuration settings as well as various artifacts that highlight connection history may

## Indicator Removal: Clear Mailbox Data

## Adversaries may modify mail and mail application data to remove evidence of their activity. Email applications allow
## users and other programs to export and delete mailbox data via command line tools or use of APIs. Mail application
## data can be emails, email metadata, or logs generated by the application or operating system, such as export requests.

## Adversaries may manipulate emails and mailbox data to remove logs, artifacts, and metadata, such as evidence of
## Phishing/Internal Spearphishing, Email Collection, Mail Protocols for command and control, or email-based exfiltration
## such as Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol. For example, to remove evidence on Exchange servers adversaries have
## used the ExchangePowerShell PowerShell module, including Remove-MailboxExportRequest to remove evidence of mailbox exports.
## On Linux and macOS, adversaries may also delete emails through a command line utility called mail or use AppleScript to
## interact with APIs on macOS.

## Adversaries may also remove emails and metadata/headers indicative of spam or suspicious activity (for example, through
## the use of organization-wide transport rules) to reduce the likelihood of malicious emails being detected by security products.

## Indicator Removal: Relocate Malware

## Once a payload is delivered, adversaries may reproduce copies of the same malware on the victim system to remove
## evidence of their presence and/or avoid defenses. Copying malware payloads to new locations may also be combined
## with File Deletion to cleanup older artifacts.

## Relocating malware may be a part of many actions intended to evade defenses. For example, adversaries may copy and
