## The adversary is trying to maintain their foothold.

## Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts,
## changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. Techniques used for
## persistence include any access, action, or configuration changes that let them maintain their foothold
## on systems, such as replacing or hijacking legitimate code or adding startup code.

## T1574 - Hijack Execution Flow: Adversaries may hijack the flow of execution of a program to execute their own code.

## T1543 - Create or Modify System Process: Adversaries may create or modify system-level processes to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence.

## T1546 - Event Triggered Execution: Adversaries may leverage event triggers to execute malicious code in response to specific events.
