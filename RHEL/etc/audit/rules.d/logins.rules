## V-230467 Successful/unsuccessful modifications to the lastlog file in RHEL 8 must generate an audit record.
## Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate
## the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. Audit records can be generated from
## various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter). The list of audited events is
## the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of
## all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records. DoD has defined the list of events for
## which RHEL 8 will provide an audit record generation capability as the following:
## 1) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels,
## or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);
## 2) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system-level access,
## starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and
## unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system;
## 3) All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations; and

## STIG (GEN002720-GEN002840: CAT II) (Previously â€“ G100-G106) The SA will
## configure the auditing system to audit the following events for all
## users and root:
##
## - Logon (unsuccessful and successful) and logout (successful)
##
## Handled by pam, sshd, login, and gdm
## Might also want to watch these files if needing extra information

## These rules are configured to monitor changes (write and attribute modifications) made to the
## /var/log/lastlog and /var/log/faillock files and tag these events with the audit key "logins."

## Explanation:
## /var/log/lastlog typically stores information about the last login times of users.
## /var/log/faillock often contains records of failed login attempts and information about user accounts
## being locked due to multiple failed login attempts.

## By using these rules, the administrator can track any modifications or changes made to these files related to login activities.
## For instance, if someone tries to tamper with the last login information (`lastlog`) or the records of failed login attempts
## (faillock), it will generate audit events tagged with the key "logins," allowing the system administrator to monitor and
## review these activities using auditd tools.

## CIS 4.1.7 Ensure login and logout events are collected
## 4.1.3.12 Ensure login and logout events are collected
## Monitor login and logout events.
## -w /var/log/lastlog -p wa -k logins

## -w /var/log/lastlog: This specifies the file path or object to watch. In this case, it's watching the /var/log/lastlog file.
## -p wa: This sets the permissions to watch for changes. "w" stands for write access, and "a" stands for attribute modification
## (e.g., permissions changes).
## -k logins: This sets a unique audit key ("logins") associated with the rule. The key helps in identifying and filtering audit
## events related to logins.

## V-230466 Successful/unsuccessful modifications to the faillock log file in RHEL 8 must generate an audit record.

## CIS 4.1.7 Ensure login and logout events are collected
-w /var/log/faillock -p wa -k logins




## NB: The remainder are not in STIG...

## the files logging the authentication failures for users
## CIS 4.1.3.12 Ensure login and logout events are collected
-w /var/run/faillock/ -p wa -k logins

## Similar to the first rule, this line watches the file /var/log/faillock.
## -p wa: As before, it sets permissions to watch for write access and attribute modification.
## -k logins: It uses the same audit key ("logins") to associate events with login-related activities.

## -w /var/log/tallylog -p wa -k logins

## /var/log/tallylog keeps track of login failure records or counts. It's related to the system's mechanism for managing login
## attempts and can be associated with tools or services like pam_tally2.

## This file stores information about failed login attempts for various user accounts on the system. Each time a user fails to log
## in (due to incorrect credentials, for example), the count associated with that user increases in the tallylog file. This mechanism
## is often used to enforce security policies, such as locking user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts to
## prevent unauthorized access.

## Verification:
## To view the events related to logout that are being audited, you can use the ausearch or ausearch command in combination
## with grep to filter for the events related to the key "logins":
##  ausearch -k logins | grep "msg=audit(.*): key=logins"

## Note: These rules above do not record logout events

## Monitor utmp and wtmp files for logout events. However, note that utmp and wtmp files contain various types of records for
## user sessions and system events, so filtering for logout events specifically can be a bit tricky.

## /var/log/utmp - The utmp file allows one to discover information about who is currently using the system.
-w /var/run/utmp -p wa -k logout

## /var/log/wtmp - The wtmp file records all logins and logouts.
-w /var/log/wtmp -p wa -k logout

## Verification:
## To view the events related to logout that are being audited, you can use the ausearch or ausearch command in combination
## with grep to filter for the events related to the key "logout":
##  ausearch -k logout | grep "msg=audit(.*): key=logout"

## CIS 4.1.8 Ensure session initiation information is collected
## Monitor session initiation events. The parameters in this section track changes to the files
## associated with session events.
##-w /var/run/utmp -p wa -k session
##-w /var/log/wtmp -p wa -k logins
-w /var/log/btmp -p wa -k logins

## The information typically recorded in /var/log/btmp includes:
## Username: The username attempted during the failed login.
## Terminal or IP address: The source of the login attempt, either the terminal or IP address from where the attempt was made.
## Timestamp: The date and time of the failed login attempt.
## Other relevant details: Additional information, depending on system configurations and services in use
