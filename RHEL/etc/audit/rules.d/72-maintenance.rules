## Record Attempts to perform maintenance activities

## If events associated with nonlocal administrative access or diagnostic sessions are not logged, a major tool for assessing and investigating
## attacks would not be available. This requirement addresses auditing-related issues associated with maintenance tools used specifically for
## diagnostic and repair actions on organizational information systems. Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities
## conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the internet) or an internal network. Local
## maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information
## system component and not communicating across a network connection. This requirement applies to hardware/software diagnostic test equipment or tools.
## This requirement does not cover hardware/software components that may support information system maintenance, yet are a part of the system, for example,
## the software implementing "ping," "ls," "ipconfig," or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch.
