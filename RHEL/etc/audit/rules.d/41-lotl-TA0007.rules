## The adversary is trying to figure out your environment.

## Discovery consists of techniques an adversary may use to gain knowledge about the system and internal
## network. These techniques help adversaries observe the environment and orient themselves before deciding
## how to act. They also allow adversaries to explore what they can control and whatâ€™s around their entry
## point in order to discover how it could benefit their current objective. Native operating system tools
## are often used toward this post-compromise information-gathering objective.
