## The adversary is trying to move through your environment.

## Lateral Movement consists of techniques that adversaries use to enter and control remote systems on a network.
## Following through on their primary objective often requires exploring the network to find their target and
## subsequently gaining access to it. Reaching their objective often involves pivoting through multiple systems
## and accounts to gain. Adversaries might install their own remote access tools to accomplish Lateral Movement
## or use legitimate credentials with native network and operating system tools, which may be stealthier.
