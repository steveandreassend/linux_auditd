# STIG

## (GEN002880: CAT II) The IAO will ensure the auditing software can
## record the following for each audit event: 
##- Date and time of the event 
##- Userid that initiated the event 
##- Type of event 
##- Success or failure of the event 
##- For I&A events, the origin of the request (e.g., terminal ID) 
##- For events that introduce an object into a user’s address space, and
##  for object deletion events, the name of the object, and in MLS
##  systems, the object’s security level.
##
## Things that could affect time

## CIS 4.1.3 Ensure events that modify date and time information are collected

## CIS Level 2
## xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_audit_rules_time_adjtimex
## Record attempts to alter time through adjtimex

## xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_audit_rules_time_settimeofday
## Record attempts to alter time through settimeofday

## xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_audit_rules_time_stime
## Record Attempts to Alter Time Through stime
## Since the 64 bit version of the "stime" system call is not defined in the audit lookup table, the corresponding "-F arch=b64"
## form of this rule is not expected to be defined on 64 bit systems (the aforementioned "-F arch=b32" stime rule form itself is
## sufficient for both 32 bit and 64 bit systems). The -k option allows for the specification of a key in string form that can be used
## for better reporting capability through ausearch and aureport. Multiple system calls can be defined on the same line to save space
## if desired, but is not required. See an example of multiple combined system calls:
## -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S adjtimex,settimeofday -F key=audit_time_rules

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S adjtimex,settimeofday,stime -F key=time-change
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S adjtimex,settimeofday -F key=time-change

## CIS Level 2
## xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_audit_rules_time_clock_settime
## Record Attempts to Alter Time Through clock_settime

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S clock_settime -F a0=0x0 -F key=time-change
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S clock_settime -F a0=0x0 -F key=time-change

## Introduced in 2.6.39, commented out in STIG because it can make false positives

##-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S clock_adjtime -F key=time-change
##-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S clock_adjtime -F key=time-change

## CIS Level 2
## xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_audit_rules_time_watch_localtime
## Record Attempts to Alter the localtime File
## -w /etc/localtime -p wa -k audit_time_rules

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -F path=/etc/localtime -F perm=wa -F key=time-change
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -F path=/etc/localtime -F perm=wa -F key=time-change
