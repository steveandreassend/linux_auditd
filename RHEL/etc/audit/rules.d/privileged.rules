## Ensure auditd Collects Information on the Use of Privileged Commands
## Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external
## entities that have compromised system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern that can have significant adverse impacts
## on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the risk from insider
## and advanced persistent threats. Privileged programs are subject to escalation-of-privilege attacks, which attempt to subvert
## their normal role of providing some necessary but limited capability. As such, motivation exists to monitor these programs for unusual activity.

## system is capable of generating audit records. DoD has defined the list of events for which RHEL 8 will provide
## an audit record generation capability as the following:
## 1) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels,
## or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);
## 2) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system-level
## access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations,
## successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system;
## 3) All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations; and 4) All kernel module load, unload, and
## restart actions.
