## Export to media (successful)
## You have to mount media before using it. You must disable all automounting
## so that its done manually in order to get the correct user requesting the
## export

## CIS 4.1.12 Ensure successful file system mounts are collected
## Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount ) system call controls the
## mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to
## create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user

## Ensure auditd Collects Information on Exporting to Media (successful)
## The unauthorized exportation of data to external media could result in an information leak where classified information,
## Privacy Act information, and intellectual property could be lost. An audit trail should be created each time a filesystem
## is mounted to help identify and guard against information loss.
