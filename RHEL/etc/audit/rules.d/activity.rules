## V-230386 The RHEL 8 audit system must be configured to audit the execution of privileged functions
## and prevent all software from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the software.
## Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by
## unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and
## ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged
## functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the risk from insider threats and the advanced
## persistent threat.

## Creating an audit log of users with temporary elevated privileges and the operation(s) they performed is essential
## to reporting. Administrators will want to correlate the events written to the audit trail with the records written
## to sudo's logfile to verify if unauthorized commands have been executed. Misuse of privileged functions, either
## intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised
## information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.
## Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the risk from insider threats
## and the advanced persistent threat.

## The intention of this optional rule on Database Servers is to log all OS commands issued by DBAs and
## their scripts. This provides end-to-end traceability of users accessing the OS and subsequently accessing
## a database using a utility such as sqlplus. This is intended to track of Break Glass activities on
## the Linux server so that user activity can be correlated with the technical justification of the approved access.

## Record the execve system call for users above UID 1000 to catch all new program executions
