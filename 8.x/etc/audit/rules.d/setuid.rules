## CIS 10.2.5.b All elevation of privileges is logged
## CIS 4.1.15 Ensure system administrator command executions (sudo) are collected

## sudo provides users with temporary elevated privileges to perform operations. Monitor the
## administrator with temporary elevated privileges and the operation(s) they performed.

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -C euid!=uid -F euid=0 -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -S execve -k actions
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -C euid!=uid -F euid=0 -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -S execve -k actions

## Refer to access.rules for logging sudo events

## STIG

## Duplicates:
## -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -F key=setuid
## -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -F key=setuid

## These rules are tailored to monitor the execution of systemd-run and pkexec on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
## They focus on instances where these commands are executed by any user other than an unset user, indicating
## active sessions. Given the nature of these commands, especially in the context of privilege escalation or
## executing actions with elevated privileges, it's important to audit their usage. The key "maybe-escalation"
## suggests a focus on security and monitoring for potential misuse or abnormal behavior.

## systemd-run is a command used to execute a process as a systemd unit
## pkexec allows an authorized user to execute programs as another user (typically the superuser).
## Both can be used for changing privileges, which is a sensitive operation.

## Special case for systemd-run. It is not audit aware, specifically watch it
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -F path=/usr/bin/systemd-run -F perm=x -F auid!=unset -F key=maybe-escalation
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -F path=/usr/bin/systemd-run -F perm=x -F auid!=unset -F key=maybe-escalation

## Special case for pkexec. It is not audit aware, specifically watch it
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -F path=/usr/bin/pkexec -F perm=x -F key=maybe-escalation
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -F path=/usr/bin/pkexec -F perm=x -F key=maybe-escalation
