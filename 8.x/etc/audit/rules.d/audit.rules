## STIG V-230403 audit system must protect logon UIDs from unauthorized change.
## Unauthorized disclosure of audit records can reveal system and configuration data to attackers,
## thus compromising its confidentiality. Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit
## records, audit settings, audit reports) needed to successfully audit RHEL 8 system activity.
## In immutable mode, unauthorized users cannot execute changes to the audit system to potentially
## hide malicious activity and then put the audit rules back. A system reboot would be noticeable
## and a system administrator could then investigate the unauthorized changes.
## Satisfies: SRG-OS-000057-GPOS-00027, SRG-OS-000058-GPOS-00028, SRG-OS-000059-GPOS-00029
## Configure the audit system to set the logon UIDs to be immutable by adding the following line to "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules"
--loginuid-immutable
