## Record the execve system call for users above UID 1000 to catch all program executions
## The intention of this optional rule is to log all OS commands issued by DBAs and their scripts
## in order to provide end-to-end traceability of users accessing the OS and subsequently accessing
## a database using a utility such as sqlplus

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -F auid>=1000 -k execall
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -F auid>=1000 -k execall

# STIG

## V-230386 The RHEL 8 audit system must be configured to audit the execution of privileged functions
## and prevent all software from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the software.
## Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by
## unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and
## ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged
## functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the risk from insider threats and the advanced
## persistent threat.
