# The finalize.rules file is an optional configuration file that can be used in the context of the auditd
# service in Linux. It allows administrators to define additional rules or configurations that will be applied
# after the main audit rules have been processed.

# When auditd starts, it loads the main audit rules usually specified in /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory
# (or a specific audit rules file like /etc/audit/audit.rules). These rules define what events or activities
# should be audited and logged by the system.

# The finalize.rules file comes into play after the main audit rules have been loaded. It provides an
# opportunity to append or modify rules that can be applied as final configurations or checks.

# Here's a typical workflow:

# 1. Loading Main Audit Rules**: On system startup or service restart, auditd loads the main audit rules
# from the configured location (like /etc/audit/audit.rules or rules defined in files within /etc/audit/rules.d/).

# 2. Applying Additional Rules via finalize.rules**: Once the main rules have been loaded, auditd checks for
# the existence of a finalize.rules file (located in the same directory). If present, it processes the rules
# defined in this file, allowing for additional or modifying audit rules to be applied as a final step.

# Administrators can use finalize.rules to perform actions such as:
# - Adding further rules to monitor specific events or actions.
# - Overriding or modifying existing rules that were set in the main audit rules.
# - Including rules that should only take effect after the primary audit rules have been established.

# It's important to note that the finalize.rules file is an optional feature and may not exist by default in
# every auditd setup. Its usage depends on the specific requirements of the system and the security policies
# in place. When present, this file helps administrators fine-tune and refine the auditing rules and configurations
# to better suit the security needs of the system.
