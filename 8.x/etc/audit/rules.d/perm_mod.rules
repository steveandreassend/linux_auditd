## V-230456 Successful/unsuccessful uses of the chmod, fchmod, and fchmodat system calls in RHEL 8 must generate an audit record
## Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization,
## it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify
## those responsible for one. Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system
## (e.g., module or policy filter). The "chmod" system call changes the file mode bits of each given file according
## to mode, which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number representing the
## bit pattern for the new mode bits. The "fchmod" system call is used to change permissions of a file. The "fchmodat"
## system call is used to change permissions of a file relative to a directory file descriptor. When a user logs on,
## the AUID is set to the UID of the account that is being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the
## loginuid set to "-1". The AUID representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals "4294967295". The audit
## system interprets "-1", "4294967295", and "unset" in the same way. The system call rules are loaded into a matching
## engine that intercepts each syscall made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use syscall
## rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit.
## Performance can be helped, however, by combining syscalls into one rule whenever possible.

## V-230455 Successful/unsuccessful uses of the chown, fchown, fchownat, and lchown system calls in RHEL 8 must generate an audit record
## Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it
## would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those
## responsible for one. Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system
## (e.g., module or policy filter). The "chown" command is used to change file owner and group. The "fchown"
## system call is used to change the ownership of a file referred to by the open file descriptor. The "fchownat"
## system call is used to change ownership of a file relative to a directory file descriptor. The "lchown" system
## call is used to change the ownership of the file specified by a path, which does not dereference symbolic links.
## When a user logs on, the AUID is set to the UID of the account that is being authenticated. Daemons are not user

## V-230413 The RHEL 8 audit system must be configured to audit any usage of the setxattr, fsetxattr, lsetxattr,
## removexattr, fremovexattr, and lremovexattr system calls
## Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization,
## it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify
## those responsible for one. Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system
## (e.g., module or policy filter). "Setxattr" is a system call used to set an extended attribute value.
## "Fsetxattr" is a system call used to set an extended attribute value. This is used to set extended attributes on a
## file. "Lsetxattr" is a system call used to set an extended attribute value. This is used to set extended attributes
## on a symbolic link. "Removexattr" is a system call that removes extended attributes. "Fremovexattr" is a system call
## that removes extended attributes. This is used for removal of extended attributes from a file. "Lremovexattr" is a
## system call that removes extended attributes. This is used for removal of extended attributes from symbolic links.

## auid!=4294967295. This condition explicitly excludes events where the AUID is set to 4294967295.
